## Introduction

An example project using [urequire](http://urequire.org), [grunt-urequire](https://github.com/aearly/grunt-urequire) & [urequire-ab-specrunner](https://github.com/anodynos/urequire-ab-specrunner).

Provides an example of grunt/urequire config for cross module systems development and cross runtimes deployment.

It comes with automagically generated tests that run on nodejs & phantomjs (browser) both as Web/AMD & Web/Script.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You should already have installed and working

```bash
  $ npm install -g grunt-cli
  $ npm install -g bower
  $ npm install -g mocha
  $ npm install -g mocha-phantomjs
```

### Download repo & install deps

Clone and install dependencies for both nodejs (npm) & browser (bower):

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/anodynos/urequire-example-helloworld && cd urequire-example-helloworld
$ npm install && bower install
```

### A full clean build & test.

Run the default build & specs test with

```bash
$ grunt
```

that builds the lib (with UMD template) and runs the specs on both nodejs & the browser (phantomjs).

The HTML spec runner and all other configs (requirejs, paths, shims, fake-module of lib inside specs etc) are automagically generated by [urequire-ab-specrunner](https://github.com/anodynos/urequire-ab-specrunner).

### Watch *real* changes

When you develop you need to watch **code** & **specs** paths and rebuild modules / resources that _seem_ to have changed. Then you want your tooling to run the specs *only* when modules have _really_ changed (i.e not to run when just whitespace or comments changed or any change that doesn't really alters the resulting parsed javascript AST). This is an example of what urequire offers.

To get all of this automation, just issue :

```bash
 $ grunt develop
```

which is really a shortcut to

```
 $ grunt lib specWatch
```

Note how `specWatch` is just derived from `spec`, just adding a `watch: true`

```
    specWatch: derive: 'spec', watch: true
```

Using `derive` allows you to inherit from other configs, like in Object Oriented Programming. You dont need to repeat existing properties, but you can add or redefine existing ones.

Under the hood, the watch feature auto generates & invokes a [`grunt-contrib-watch`](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) task, through the [`urequire-ab-grunt-contrib-watch`](https://github.com/anodynos/urequire-ab-grunt-contrib-watch]) `afterBuild`-er.
